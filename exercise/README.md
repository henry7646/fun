# exercise

SQL, PLSQL, and R codes for collecting and visualizing my own daily health records, such as:

**Measure** | **Metric**
----------- ----------
weight | kg
------ --
waist | cm
----- --
hip | cm
--- --
WHR | waist/hip
--- ---------
BMI | weight/(1.69)^2
--- ---------------

\*Originally, BMI(Body Mass Index) = weight(kg)/height(m)^2: I simply plugged in my own height in the table above.
\*I might update this file with other excercise / health related projects in the future.
