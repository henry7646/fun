# exercise

SQL, PLSQL, and R codes for collecting and visualizing my own daily health records, such as:

|**Measure**|**Metric**|
|:---------:|:--------:|
weight|kg
waist|cm
hip|cm
WHR|waist/hip
BMI|weight/(1.69)<sup>2</sup>

\*Originally, BMI(Body Mass Index) = weight(kg)/height(m)<sup>2</sup>: I simply plugged in my own height in the table above.  
\*I might update this file with other excercise / health related projects in the future.
