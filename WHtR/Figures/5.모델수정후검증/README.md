# 모델수정후검증
This file is for saving plots necessary for checking **if the revised LSDV(least-sqaures dummy variable) model *regressing body fat percentage(BFP) on waist-height ratio(WHtR), gender, WHtR\*gender, and month dummy variables* satisfies the OLS(ordinary least squares) assumptions better than the previous LSDV model *regressing BFP on WHtR, gender, and month dummy variables*.** In particular, these plots are for checking **if there is less non-linear pattern between the residuals and the fitted values on the scatterplot.**
