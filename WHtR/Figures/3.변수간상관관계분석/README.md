* The correlation matrix with scatterplots, showing Pearson correlation coefficients between variables of interest (age, BMI, waist-to-height ratio(WHtR), and body fat percentage(BFP))
* Distribution of variables of interest (age, gender, BMI, WHtR, and BFP) month by month - it is necessary to visually check how the time(month) influences major variables before applying the pooled cross-section/least-squares dummy variable(LSDV: here, the dummy variable is time dummy variable) model.
